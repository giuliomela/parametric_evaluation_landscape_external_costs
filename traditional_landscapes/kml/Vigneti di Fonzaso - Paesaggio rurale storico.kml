    <name>Vigneti di Fonzaso - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

L’area, inoltre, rappresenta il sito di conservazione di vitigni autoctoni di particolare interesse come Bianchetta gentile, Cirnesera, Grassella, Rossarda, Pavana, Grinta, Clinton. Le tecniche di impianto sono caratteristiche, si trovano impianti a palo secco, a sostegno vivo con una specifica terminologia dialettale che li identifica (gli altaii), ma anche le pergole e il sistema col galòn. L’integrità del paesaggio storico si è molto ridotta a partire dal dopoguerra, e oggi solo su alcuni versanti si sono conservati i vigneti originari su terrazzi. Ciò è dovuto sia all’abbandono, avvenuto a partire da fine ‘800, sia a fattori quali la fillossera (insetto dannoso per la vite) e le altre patologie che hanno in parte distrutto il patrimonio vitivinicolo.<br>Il perdurare dell’abbandono delle coltivazioni, fenomeno che non si è esaurito negli ultimi anni, rende vulnerabile tutto il territorio, lasciando peraltro avanzare il bosco che ha sgretolato in parte gli antichi terrazzi. La recente leggera ripresa della viticoltura rischia di compromettere gli antichi terrazzamenti a secco, in quanto condotta secondo nuovi sesti di impianto del vigneto che favoriscono la meccanizzazione. <br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2Eh4D2X)]]></description>

Si possono osservare due diverse tipologie di allevamento della vite: a sx allevamento a "spalliera" in cui la vite viene fatta crescere in filari più o meno lunghi, costituiti solitamente da pali di legno, con impatto sul paesaggio e sull’ambiente decisamente migliore (o acciaio, plastica, etc.), su cui vengono fissati dei fili di acciaio posti in tensione tra i pali.<br>La superficie vegetativa della pianta si sviluppa così perpendicolarmente al terreno. A destra sistemazione a pergola alta in cui la chioma viene stesa su un tetto orizzontale, anziché fatta crescere in verticale lungo una spalliera.<br>La pergola è il sistema più usato al mondo per la produzione di uva da tavola, in quanto consente di raccogliere grappoli più integri, spesso più grandi e più uniformi come colorazione.

        <description><![CDATA[A ridosso del Monte Avena si trovano  incastonate nella roccia viva due costruzioni bianche: l'eremo e la casa di San Micel. Simbolo del paese di Fonzaso, l'eremo si trova dove prima vi era il castello della famiglia Fonzasia, distrutto per ordine del Senato Veneto. Per costruire l'eremo e altre costruzioni del paese, compreso il campanile, furono utilizzati i resti del castello.  La casa di San Michele si trova a circa a 550 m s.l.m è fu costruita per ospitare un "vigile del fuoco"  che doveva vigilare sul paese colpito da numerosi incendi, e suonare la campana d'allarme quando ne avvistava uno. Per il mantenimento del vigile del fuoco, la popolazione versava annualmente una tassa detta "minella" che corrispondeva a circa 2kg di farina di granoturco. Accanto alla casa è stata costruita una chiesetta agganciata direttamente alla montagna, molto modesta nelle sue linee. All'interno troviamo la raffigurazione dell'Arcangelo Michele che sconfigge Lucifero. Da qui si può osservare tutto il paesaggio ]]></description>

        <name>Torrente Cismon</name>
        <description>Importante per l’irrigazione e la storia di questi territori è il torrente Cismon, considerato “delizia e croce” allo stesso tempo, forte, impetuoso, a volte violento. Il Cismon nasce a passo Rolle ed esce dalla stretta gola che scende dal Primiero. Molte sono state le imbrigliature fatte con enormi sacche di sassi “briglie”, legate fra loro sulle sponde o messe di traverso per rallentare la corsa. Il risultato era comunque la distruzione del ponte di legno che collegava il capoluogo alle frazioni di Frassené ed Agana. La grande utilità delle sue acque fece grande Fonzaso durante la dominazione veneziana per la fluitazione del legname dalla valle del Primiero. Tutt’ora attraverso piccole canalizzazioni di irrigazione la piana è resa rigogliosa su ambo le sponde.</description>
