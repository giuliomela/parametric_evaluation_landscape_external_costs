    <name>Vigneti tradizionali del Mandrolisai - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali]]></description>

Qui la viticoltura ha un’antichissima tradizione e ha dato luogo a un paesaggio caratterizzato da vigneti di dimensioni ridotte, condotti in asciutto e allevati in larga maggioranza, l’80% circa, ad alberello, mentre la restante parte è costituita da basse spalliere. La coltivazione ad alberello, di origine greca e fenicia, caratterizza storicamente la viticoltura del Sud dell’Italia, contrapponendosi alla vite maritata di diffusione etrusca del Centro-Nord. <br>Gli appezzamenti nell’area sono tra loro suddivisi da fasce di vegetazione arbustiva e arborea, riconducibili alla macchia mediterranea a lentisco e olivastro. Questo gioco di campi chiusi da siepi e alberate rende decisamente articolato il mosaico del paesaggio. La ridotta superficie e la presenza nei vigneti di alberi da frutto, e talvolta anche di piccoli orti, ne comprova l’uso familiare. Il vino prodotto nella zona è compreso nella DOC Mandrolisai, denominazione istituita con decreto del 6 giugno 1981. Una particolarità di questo vino è la ripartizione in campo dei tre vitigni (Monica, Bovale e Cannonau) che concorrono all’uvaggio.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Forma di allevamento della vite, di elevato interesse storico, che non prevede alcun sostegno. È utilizzato nei terreni con forti pendenze, condizioni ambientali difficili e scarsità d’acqua.<br> Le radici della pianta tendono a sfruttare il più possibile la “verticalità” per raggiungere gli strati più profondi ricchi di minerali e allo stesso tempo non vengono penalizzate dalle condizioni ambientali esterne di caldo estremo.]]></description>
