    <name>Mosaico paesistico del Montalbano - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Si tratta di un’area estesa per circa 550 ettari, con altitudini comprese tra i 50 e i 400 metri s.l.m..<br>Il paesaggio attorno al piccolo borgo di Larciano è un esempio significativo di un ‘tipo paesaggistico’ frequente nei rilievi collinari toscani: la coltura prevalente è l’oliveto tradizionale, che si ritrova su gran parte dei pendii laterali e che spesso arriva a rasentare la viabilità di crinale, tanto da costituire un drappo arboreo di notevole valore paesistico e un elemento rappresentativo dell’identità colturale del territorio. Gli oliveti si trovano spesso su versanti ciglionati o terrazzati, e non è rara la presenza di piante da frutto tra gli stessi olivi. Nell’area sono presenti anche alcuni vigneti, anche se su superfici molto ridotte, da cui si produce il vino DOCG Chianti sottozona Montalbano, mentre l’olio è riconosciuto dalla DOP Toscana sottozona Montalbano. Le formazioni boschive sono estese soprattutto nelle forre e sui versanti con condizioni di pendenza e assolazione sfavorevoli alla coltivazione. Nel territorio di Larciano è attorno al borgo che ruota la struttura territoriale, con la viabilità in posizione di crinale, con le pendici della dorsale destinate alle coltivazioni, le forre di fondovalle e gli altri suoli più acclivi occupati dal bosco.<br>(foto: M.

        <description><![CDATA[L’area è situata sul versante empolese del Montalbano e si presenta come una dorsale secondaria con orientamento nord-est/sud-ovest. È delimitata a nord dalla linea del crinale principale, a sud dalle ondulazioni collinari formate dai depositi marini e lacustri che digradano dolcemente verso la pianura, mentre a ovest e a est i confini sono definiti da due corsi d’acqua (il Fosso Agnese e il Fosso delle Gargole). Il substrato geologico è costituito dalla formazione detta Macigno del Chianti, in cui si trovano arenarie feldspatiche con intercalazioni argillose.<br><br>IMPORTANTE: la localizzazione dell'icona in mappa è puramente indicativa.]]></description>
