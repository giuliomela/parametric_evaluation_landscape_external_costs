    <name>Policolture di Loretello - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Le coltivazioni prevalenti sono quelle del farro, del mais, delle cicerchie, dell’ulivo e della vite, con produzioni di alta qualità. Sia il farro di Loretello, che le cicerchie, sono riconosciuti quali Prodotti Agroalimentari Tradizionali dal Ministero delle politiche agricole alimentari, forestali e del turismo.<br>Le zone più vicine ai crinali sono in genere condotte a prato-pascolo ed è ancora notevole, in alcune zone, la presenza di aree boscate intervallate da aree coltivate e da pascoli.<br>La peculiarità del paesaggio circostante Loretello non risiede solamente nella presenza delle tradizionali policolture, ma anche nell’unicità del rapporto tra le colline coltivate e gli insediamenti storici di poggio, primo fra tutti il Castello di Loretello, che domina i pendii circostanti.<br>(foto: A.
