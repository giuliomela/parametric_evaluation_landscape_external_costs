    <name>Montagnola senese di Spannocchia - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

La fattoria costituisce un esempio significativo della persistenza storica del paesaggio agrario della Montagnola, con seminativi e vaste aree boscate, che coprono circa l’82 per cento della tenuta.<br>I primi documenti scritti riguardanti l’area risalgono al 1225 e si riferiscono a una donazione di una porzione della fattoria da parte di Zacaria dei Spannocchi a favore dei monaci del vicino convento di Santa Lucia. La fattoria è rimasta di proprietà della famiglia Spannocchi fino agli inizi del XX secolo, quando fu venduta al fiorentino Delfino Cinelli, un aristocratico scrittore.<br>La tenuta continuò a svolgere il suo ruolo di centro di produzione agricola con il sistema della mezzadria, fino al secondo dopoguerra, quando il figlio di Delfino, il conte Ferdinando Cinelli, trasformò la fattoria in un centro culturale ed educativo, grazie anche alla fondazione nel 1959, da parte dello stesso Ferdinando, della Etruscan Foundation.<br>Oggi il castello di Spannocchia è divenuto un museo vivente della vita rurale tradizionale della Toscana, dove le attività agricole vengono attuate con grande attenzione alle caratteristiche storiche del paesaggio e al mantenimento della sua integrità. La vocazione produttiva è orientata alla produzione biologica di vino, olio, frutta e verdura. La fattoria, pur essendo autonoma, è comunque immersa in un contesto territoriale sottoposto a trasformazioni continue, ed è vulnerabile alla pianificazione, agli andamenti dei flussi turistici e al mercato agricolo. <br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2Bz4eIG)]]></description>
