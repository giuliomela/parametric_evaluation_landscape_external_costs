    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Durante la dominazione araba sono state introdotte nuove specie caratterizzate da elevati fabbisogni idrici, tra questi l’arancio amaro e il limone. Oggi solo le borgate di Ciaculli e Croceverde rappresentano il paesaggio agrario tradizionale della Conca d’Oro, mantenendo il disegno originale dell’agrumicoltura, in forma di compatte monocolture. I fondi agricoli, chiusi da muri (firriati), sono caratterizzati dalla presenza di bagli (magazzini, poi dimore, fortificati), che conservano l’impianto originario. Nelle aree a quote più elevate, ai piedi dei rilievi calcarei, gli agrumi si trovano su terrazzamenti in pietra. Tra gli agrumi coltivati si ricordano il mandarino “tardivo di Ciaculli”, il mandarino “Avana”, le nespole giganti rosse di Ciaculli, limoni, albicocche e arance. il caratteristico disegno del suolo è segnato dalle canalizzazioni principali e secondarie (saje, cunnutti) e dalle vasche di raccolta (gebbie). <br>(foto: Conca d’oro panorama: http://www.salviamoilpaesaggio.it/blog/2012/12/palermo-la-sfida-del-recupero-della-conca-doro/)]]></description>
