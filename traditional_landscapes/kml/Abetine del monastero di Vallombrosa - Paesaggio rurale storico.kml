    <name>Abetine del monastero di Vallombrosa - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

L’area è molto rilevante sia per la persistenza storica del modello di gestione forestale che vi troviamo e che per secoli ha fornito legname di abete, sia per il ruolo di Vallombrosa nello sviluppo delle Scienze forestali in Italia. <br>I monaci a partire dal XVI secolo, iniziarono un fruttuoso commercio di legname, attraverso una gestione dell’abetina basata su criteri che favorivano popolamenti coetanei, monospecifici, con piantagioni regolari, a file, di giovani piantine in sostituzione di quelle abbattute. La selvicoltura attuata dai monaci fu successivamente sviluppata dagli amministratori della prima scuola forestale italiana fondata a Vallombrosa nel 1869. In conseguenza di questi indirizzi,dai circa 245 ha del 1869, l’abetina oggi ricopre più di 600 ha, dei quali circa il 70% gestiti con tagli a raso (il taglio di tutti gli alberi presenti in una certa area di bosco), almeno fino verso il 1970. <br>Al momento attuale Vallombrosa vede la presenza di un Silvomuseo, gestito dal Corpo forestale dello Stato, e dell’Arboreto, con una ricchissima raccolta di specie forestali.<br>(foto: M.
