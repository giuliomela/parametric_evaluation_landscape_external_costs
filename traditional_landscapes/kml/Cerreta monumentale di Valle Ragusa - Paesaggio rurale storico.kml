    <name>Cerreta monumentale di Valle Ragusa - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

L’altitudine varia da 580 a 800 m s.l.m.<br>L’area, di proprietà comunale, è interessata dal Parco Nazionale del Gargano. La sua significatività riguarda la persistenza storica secolare di un bosco monumentale di lontanissime origini, sfruttato dalle popolazioni locali per il ricercatissimo legname. Il bosco è infatti caratterizzato dalla presenza di piante di cerro (Quercus cerris L.) nel piano dominante e di un fitto piano dominato da carpino bianco (Carpinus betulus L.).<br>I cerri di Valle Ragusa erano utilizzati per la produzione di tavolame per le costruzioni navali e per le traversine ferroviarie. Il nome della valle, secondo alcuni studiosi, sarebbe legato alla presenza di popolazioni provenienti da Ragusa, l’odierna Dubronvik, posta sull’altra sponda dell’Adriatico in territorio croato. Secondo Braudel i ragusei cercavano il legname nelle foreste di querce del Gargano per le costruzioni navali per rivalità commerciale con Venezia.<br>Oggi, l’esercizio del pascolo nel bosco contribuisce a mantenere integro il paesaggio e sgombro il suolo. Tuttavia, la vulnerabilità dell’area è legato all’abbandono colturale; infatti l’invecchiamento degli esemplari di cerro determina l’occupazione dello spazio da parte del carpino bianco.<br>(foto http://www.turismomontesantangelo.it)]]></description>
