    <name>Rupe di Orvieto - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

L’area di estende per circa 500 ettari ad altitudini comprese tra 120 e 325 m s.l.m. su terreni di proprietà privata.<br>La persistenza storica di colture agricole di elevata qualità crea un paesaggio di grande valenza estetica. L’area è significativa proprio perché il paesaggio agrario si è sviluppato e caratterizzato pur essendo strettamente connesso al centro urbano. Qui si ritrovano molti vigneti che producono un vino bianco italiano di ottima qualità, l’Orvieto DOC e territori coperti da oliveti estesi da cui si ricava l’olio DOP Umbria.<br>I pendii della Rupe hanno da sempre rappresentato la base dell’economia orvietana. L’armonizzazione tra le due zone, agricola e cittadina, è garantita da piccole formazioni boschive, che dallo sperone tufaceo scendono verso la valle. Nella zona meridionale della Rupe, esposta a sud e facilmente accessibile i terreni sono in prevalenza coltivati con specie ortofrutticole, inframmezzati da modesti vigneti e oliveti. Il paesaggio si mostra integro proprio grazie al perdurare delle attività agricole tradizionali.<br>La viticoltura, anche se caratterizzata da una produzione intensiva, non ha tuttavia permesso l’espansione urbana a scapito delle zone agricole, mentre la olivicoltura si è mantenuta stabile nel corso del tempo. Il paesaggio tradizionale è oggi minacciato da fenomeni di erosione che si manifestano soprattutto laddove è venuto a mancare l’utilizzo agricolo dei terreni, anche a causa dell’invecchiamento della popolazione dedita all’agricoltura.<br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2HeC2hI)]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Il ceduo è una forma di governo del bosco; in seguito al taglio delle piante, il rinnovamento avviene ad opera dei polloni (nuovi fusti) che si originano da gemme presenti sulla ceppaia (la base del tronco che rimane sul terreno dopo l’abbattimento) mediante riproduzione per via vegetativa (agamica).<br>Tra le specie forestali della penisola soltanto le latifoglie sono dotate di capacità pollonifera.]]></description>
