    <name>Oliveti monumentali di Gioia Tauro - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

La monumentalità degli oliveti e la loro estensione rende questo paesaggio molto significativo. L’olivicoltura qui era già consolidata nel periodo romano e si è mantenuta anche nei secoli successivi.<br>Nel XVII secolo questa risultava l’unica attività economica in continua espansione; la potatura era pratica sconosciuta e ciò spiega il portamento monumentale delle piante, mentre il suolo sottostante gli oliveti di primo impianto veniva seminato per alcuni anni e le paglie rimaste dopo il raccolto bruciate. Lungo le coste del Tirreno, l’olivicoltura interessava, fino al XVII secolo, le aree di collina mentre le terre pianeggianti erano destinate a frumento, vite, ortaggi e fruttiferi.<br>Nel corso del XVIII secolo avvennero fatti destinati a cambiare il paesaggio agrario della Piana: la scomparsa del gelso e dell’industria della seta, l’aumento del consumo d’olio per l’illuminazione pubblica, l’industria tessile e l’alimentazione dei ceti urbani, una minore pressione fiscale sull’olio. Gli uliveti cominciarono a essere impiantati anche sui territori pianeggianti e, sul finire del secolo, la specializzazione olivicola investiva anche i centri da sempre interessati alle colture seminative.<br>(foto: A.

        <description>L’olivicoltura della Piana di Gioia è certamente uno degli esempi più straordinari e complessi di monocoltura arborea di grande estensione. È l’area definita da Medici (1961) «latifondo contadino». Le colture hanno un’espressione omogenea e specializzata, con un sesto d’impianto 15 x 15, ovvero a sesto regolare (nel sesto d’impianto regolare - quadrato o rettangolare - le piante sono collocate in filari paralleli, distanti tra loro alcuni metri, formando, di conseguenza, una griglia geometrica) Gli ulivi, capaci di raggiungere e di superare i 20 m di altezza, si trovano talvolta consociati agli agrumi, solo in posizione limitrofa. Sono presenti tre varietà: Ciciarello (impollinatrice) Sinopolese e Ottobraticao Perciasacchi, che domina la parte bassa. </description>
