    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

L’avvio della bonifica del territorio iniziò a partire dal XVIII secolo. Inizialmente i terreni sottratti alle paludi furono destinati alla coltivazione del riso o al pascolo.<br>Nell’Ottocento, dopo la caduta della Repubblica di Venezia, l’azienda passò a diversi proprietari, fino a quando Giovanni Corte la comprò, dandole una configurazione e un’estensione simile a quella attuale. Iniziò così una risistemazione unitaria dell’azienda che, pur con l’alternarsi di nuovi proprietari, fu definitivamente portata a termine con un’opera di bonifica integrale, tra gli anni Trenta e Quaranta del secolo scorso.<br>Dal 2000 l’area è gestita dalla Fondazione Cassamarca, società con scopi di utilità sociale e di promozione dello sviluppo economico, che ha intrapreso diverse attività volte alla valorizzazione dell’area, tra le quali alcune si ricollegano direttamente alla valorizzazione storica e culturale dell’azienda.<br>Qui vengono coltivate la soia, il mais, il frumento e l’erba medica e, inoltre, ci sono vigneti, boschi e seminativi. Grazie alla sua localizzazione, sostanzialmente marginale rispetto alla viabilità principale, e alla presenza del fiume Sile a sud, il territorio si è conservato sostanzialmente non intaccato dai fenomeni di urbanizzazione diffusa.<br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2TbwCKQ)]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Il ceduo è una forma di governo del bosco; in seguito al taglio delle piante, il rinnovamento avviene ad opera dei polloni (nuovi fusti) che si originano da gemme presenti sulla ceppaia (la base del tronco che rimane sul terreno dopo l’abbattimento) mediante riproduzione per via vegetativa (agamica).<br>Tra le specie forestali della penisola soltanto le latifoglie sono dotate di capacità pollonifera.]]></description>
