    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Tale permanenza è dimostrata dal fatto che ancora oggi si coltiva una varietà che fornisce un prodotto legato in modo indissolubile al territorio locale: la castagna di varietà gabbina.<br>Il paesaggio è caratterizzato non solo dalla presenza di castagni, in parte con caratteri monumentali, ma anche dalla diffusione di modeste abitazioni rurali isolate,realizzate in corrispondenza di piccole radure, coltivate a ortaglie, alberi da frutta o vite, per la sussistenza nel nucleo familiare insediato. ]]></description>

        <description>L’importanza storica del castagneto da frutto è immensa; questa forma di coltura, che integra le caratteristiche di un bosco di alto fusto con quelle di un frutteto, e che svolge una funzione preventiva dei dissesti idrogeologici, rappresentò per secoli il patrimonio in grado di permettere la vita delle comunità umane in ambienti montani, in situazioni svantaggiate. Il castagno, inoltre, è relativamente frugale e riesce a produrre un alimento dalle notevoli caratteristiche organolettiche anche su superfici con caratteristiche (in particolare la pendenza) tali da impedire ogni altra forma di coltura. La coltura tradizionale del castagneto da frutto prevede che le piante siano quasi tutte innestate, allo scopo di produrre castagne di buona qualità, e che siano sottoposte a periodiche cure, in modo da mantenerle produttive anche oltre il secolo di vita.

L’integrità è oggi assicurata anche dalla presenza di una cooperativa di imprenditori locali (Il Teccio), che si propone di mantenere e promuovere l’antica tecnica di raccolta e conservazione, con azioni di valorizzazione paesistica e territoriale, ottenendo il riconoscimento della classificazione Igp sotto la denominazione di «Castagna essiccata nei tecci di Calizzano e Murialdo».<br><br>IMPORTANTE: la localizzazione del prodotto in mappa è puramente indicativa.]]></description>

La parte meridionale dell’area considerata presenta un substrato in parte costituito da dolomie più o meno calcaree grigie, in parte da quarziti biancastre e verdoline e da porfiroidi a grana minuta. La parte verso nord ha invece un substrato geologico costituito dalla «Formazione di Ollano», originatasi nel carbonifero superiore, e formata da conglomerati prevalentemente quarzosi, arenarie, filladi, filladi quarzose, arenarie e micascisti.<br><br>IMPORTANTE: la localizzazione dell'icona in mappa è puramente indicativa.]]></description>
