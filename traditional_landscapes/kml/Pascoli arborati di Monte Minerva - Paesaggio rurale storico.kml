    <name>Pascoli arborati di Monte Minerva - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali. Si ringrazia il GAL Logudoro-Goceano per il contributo alla realizzazione della scheda.]]></description>

L’integrità del paesaggio è fortemente legata alla presenza di un’attività zootecnica e pascoliva con carichi adeguati. Nel fondo della vallecola l’attività zootecnica è tuttora praticata, in particolare sono presenti allevamenti di cavalli, alimentati anche per pascolamento diretto.<br>La minaccia principale per il paesaggio locale deriva dall’abbandono delle pratiche tradizionali e, in particolar modo, dall’interruzione delle capitozzature: la struttura delle chiome non è infatti stata rinnovata e non sono state avviate nuove capitozze.

È situato nel centro storico del paese, di fronte alla chiesa di Santo Stefano e alla Porta del Parco Grazia Deledda; sul retro è presente un vasto patio con ampia vista sul territorio circostante e sulla valle del Temo.<br>Si tratta di una struttura di approfondimento tematico della cultura materiale locale inserita a sua volta nell’itinerario integrato del Parco deleddiano, che ha tra le sue principali finalità la valorizzazione e la riscoperta delle antiche tradizioni e saperi dell’isola.<br>Al suo interno è visitabile l’allestimento del Centro di documentazione che ripercorre la storia della panificazione in Sardegna ed in particolare si possono conoscere ed apprendere le tecniche di lavorazione del pane e dei dolci tipici di Monteleone Rocca Doria. Parte importante dell’intero progetto espositivo è infatti la presenza di un’area didattico - divulgativa con la presenza di spazi per la degustazione e di un laboratorio attraverso il quale sperimentare e scoprire l'antica arte di lavorazione dei pani sardi tradizionali e delle feste nonché le tecniche odierne.<br>Tutto è accompagnato da un vasto apparato di pannelli esplicativi con testi ed immagini che ripercorrono l’intero ciclo produttivo a partire dal lavoro dei campi, dalla semina del grano, passando per la preparazione degli ingredienti e la loro successiva trasformazione.<br>Si trovano inoltre esposti molti degli strumenti - setacci, canestri, mestoli - utilizzati in passato per questa produzione e si possono ammirare vari tipi di pane provenienti da tutta l’isola ed in particolare i pani tipici di Monteleone: tra i più conosciuti “su moddizzolu”, una pagnotta alta e soffice che si preparava ogni settimana; “su zicchi”, pane piatto senza mollica e di forma rotonda, che si consumava in primavera o in autunno; “su zicchi ladu in iscadda”, un pane rituale di piccole dimensioni dalle forme fantasiose; “su pistoccu”, l’ancora tipico pane croccante preparato nei mesi estivi.<br>(fonte: visitviva.com)<br><br><img src="https://mymaps.usercontent.google.com/hostedimage/m/*/3AEDAZkoECKOkcV_ao54cjd3DumpHT9PrTgXkNOLXq2D8iUkXhIiExnVt3M-RoPuGYTa233A4sXSow4_i8pqSbuHYMPvgyE4GhkS_Hm2GXvMeO3lbHlCJtEzfkkVYzJPPukKAiZfc5FHteN1fhTOexLlEdgGAzCflgknzrfJGGK8SWOoTnl43V78tRMgadAuKa2lBGA8Nw4tt27lJlwiHrNctl1p6shsfWeo4DX2jwnCtmrYsT0fF0KAilRzmEC8?authuser=0&fife=s16383" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://mymaps.usercontent.google.com/hostedimage/m/*/3AEDAZkoDjeIMzUnIJboHOjJ85U1p5e2ODsMHLjc23ONRQ_rgtQyoSjOLRY9ryeTow_BWPA_Qb3dzlwpVYuMh7kU2-bzwlUi73eiRVcJ3YNnfl5wJLF_-9vl08ONxaN9top6Nm58MAxL-bUK-nV9WlkJu7aZmEIbLe_tGuaWzIn_eMNo0yy0hBK7kKfJSYHxxNfO0eooLBc6R8gd4HRpCNmVw-aFpN1hrmPC-m4XdKiJTZFehCqL1NYCDYB1iHHc?authuser=0&fife=s16383" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://mymaps.usercontent.google.com/hostedimage/m/*/3AEDAZkq6DesdvOYcKKuZExDsy8iFPNUTaj-VAy6we-O-r_M3gyc3rujnbxI4fyEM6ul6cf-0jEby7ilarek932ZHTV-hse22GE5lLBjVM9XVo7k5IzU0Zhl64vxH2Ooy8IQWR6W2hGftomlim-lcjU4ngmZChMz6xd96nhvSNI-H-Ouy64TfR4sOXeMhHGQ6EU6V_EtAT9wbehaqHxnJQ85p7YiYg-k4v06F9-ldYvnx-UMy90Ab9V9-dxqejsI?authuser=0&fife=s16383" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://mymaps.usercontent.google.com/hostedimage/m/*/3AEDAZkqmcRLVLTE2PtZFVEGWn1fBignjSBYMc87MvXoVY6fN13YqG2aw17JN_MuA_H10JwNMVErmTOezZW2YiHvsRydC23YGQ1y0vaDMiG5SPXuKhaqeltBJWVw2FooKRqu7svmVF0q992tzbNB76zmKBEQ7X4R0UhsPTJmjEX8bO3QyRfgDOJCMr0gSG8w8I48dnPK_mzTKqvfM1GfxVfBPjcsApXSSpSn4PcDpEqOOBQ4oOMJUkZr6Hg_IAsg?authuser=0&fife=s16383" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

Questa regione storica è situata a Nord-Ovest della Sardegna, in Provincia di Sassari ed è sede del Sito di Interesse Comunitario (SIC ITB020041 – Entroterra e Zona Costiera tra Bosa, Capo Marargiu e P. Tangone), caratterizzato da una eccezionale varietà di ambienti e da un importante patrimonio naturalistico, ambientale, storico e culturale.<br>Monte Minerva è il residuo geologico di un più esteso altopiano vulcanico, costituito da rioliti e piroclastiti, ora eroso tutto intorno. Vicino, l’abitato di Monteleone Rocca Doria sorge su un rilievo calcareo-arenaceo. La morfologia dell’area è in parte più dolce, con ampie valli, mentre le pendici circostanti il Monte Minerva sono piuttosto ripide.<br>(foto: visitviva.com)<br><br>IMPORTANTE: la localizzazione dell'icona in mappa è puramente indicativa.]]></description>

Molto più piccole degli esseri umani, in qualche modo sono una versione sarda degli elfi. Si dice siano creature per niente spirituali, ma demoni nel senso greco del termine, in altre parole esseri a metà strada fra il mondo umano e quello divino. La loro piccola taglia permetteva loro di vivere nelle “Domus” che sarebbero piccoli alloggi costruiti nella roccia. Le Domus sono in realtà delle caverne funerarie scavate nella roccia dalle antiche civiltà sarde più di 5.000 anni fa. Le caverne erano posizionate una accanto all’altra in numero elevato, a formare necropoli che potevano ospitare fino a un centinaio di corpi. I corpi erano depositati in posizione fetale accanto agli averi che si credeva fossero necessari per il viaggio verso l’aldilà. <br><br>Fonte. https://www.sardegna.com<br><br><img src="https://mymaps.usercontent.google.com/hostedimage/m/*/3AEDAZkrJwhhY16n5x0sVimXvFqeLJW2ZK6xiNucH6AXusHuuMQku4bsJy0jqSXkNNSDiiaSH4QQX9wBZJuvzdYgaPYE6VhX1U6Im3g_71-Yny_ArVw7tEEk8jR8jTkujMSJFa2QzAnTT523GFivDDnN0LqWPdhe1TQYzFlKlQl9fMoOl-ly2NCs5OxRsJLOtz_RO1UMYjzhBwmKMh9ra1nxZynLBRlzDEejV8tzn9TkORvFXGDFbLZ1htxbemaQ?authuser=0&fife=s16383" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://mymaps.usercontent.google.com/hostedimage/m/*/3AEDAZkrjm_eJC1JFi6hDv7Boj-erKGOcYO1-Un-GN2r81dubXmMg64vE2tjp9AjUNUneuzRX8WgdenPH5rE9thfq6JzLWwoThhtGPnpT3yNxor7Mer3TAFIZ_2TBB8eoBdAlufRwJhtx4yIXTdFtBbes2p19t7XRglTMunW3AuwAZmbTyjbjipCMLIqyJIVDwxRBNP-zasl-dLBeCVagd9T9PjDla2xwwFUIrV54OyKWSqjbn2mV6AIkgK9lHis?authuser=0&fife=s16383" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

Suggestiva la protometaurina scolpita all'ingresso di una di queste tombe di età prenuragica. <br>(foto: sardegnaambiente.it)]]></description>

Vi sono i ruderi della chiesa di S.Maria di Curos, imponente chiesa in romanico francese, forse di maestranze cistercensi. La tradizione ricorda un monastero di S.Maria de Curos, di benedettini ignoti. Veniva ricordato solo nelle collettorie pontificie del XIV secolo col nome di "Coriaso" appartenente alla diocesi di Bosa. Citato dall'Aleo nel XVII secolo.<br>La chiesa, innalzata con bei conci di trachite bianca e basalto grigio, ricorda vagamente la cattedrale di S.Pietro di Sorres. Rimane in piedi il solo lato settentrionale e i resti degli altri tre, tra cui l'abside semicircolare rivolta verso nord-ovest. In un concio si legge la firma del progettista "Mastru Comita". I cumuli di pietrame sparsi per circa due ettari nei dintorni, a km 2 SO da Monteleone, ai bordi del lago, e una copiosa sorgente testimoniano l'esistenza di un importante agglomerato urbano, di cui, purtroppo, non rimane traccia nelle fonti storiche.<br>(foto:http://www.visitviva.com)]]></description>
