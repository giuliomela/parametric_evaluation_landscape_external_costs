        <description>Il paesaggio di questo tratto è soprattutto quello dei pascoli, ma non mancano i terrazzamenti realizzati a fatica con muretti a secco per permettere la crescita di alberi da frutto (fico, mandorlo, sorbo e soprattutto olivo). Questi muri di contenimento a secco consentono la creazione di coltivazioni a terrazze (detti appunto terrazzamenti) creando superfici pianeggianti da dedicare all’agricoltura, su territori caratterizzati da una pendenza più o meno accentuata. Questa tecnica è molto importante per l’economia agricola e crea fantastici paesaggi. Dal 2018 anche l’Unesco ha riconosciuto l’importanza e l’abilità L’”Arte dei muretti a secco”, inserendoli nella Lista del Patrimonio Culturale Immateriale dell’umanità</description>

        <name>Capra garganica</name>
        <description>Emblema della pastorizia, è la capra garganica, razza autoctona originaria del promontorio, Dal pelo di colore molto scuro e lungo, corna ritorte e barbetta sotto il mento, è una specie rustica che si adatta ad ogni tipo di clima. La sua carne, molto saporita, si presenta di colore bianco o rosa chiaro, compatta, morbida alla cottura e leggermente infiltrata di grasso. Il bianco cacioricotta, fatto esclusivamente dal latte di capra, ha sapore sapido e leggermente piccante. Ottima anche la ricotta morbida crema da gustare anche solo con il pane e il pecorino adatto per insaporire, come formaggio da grattugia, molti piatti della cucina locale. Molto apprezzata è la carne, con la classica teglia con patate, oppure per la preparazione dei torcinelli. La musciska è prodotto anche dall’essiccamento della carne di caprino e successivamente trattato con sale e spezie.                                                                     IMPORTANTE: la localizzazione del prodotto in mappa è puramente indicativa</description>

La zona di Monte Sant’Angelo è formata da calcari, calcareniti, calcari terrosi bianchi e calcari biogenici, mentre la zona di Mattinata è formata da calcari grossolani con molluschi nella parte più vicina all’abitato, e da alluvioni recenti non terrazzate nella parte a quote più basse.                                                        IMPORTANTE: la localizzazione dell'icona in mappa è puramente indicativa]]></description>

        <description>L’emergenza geologica in oggetto si rinviene lungo il versante meridionale del Gargano in località Coppa Caramanica. La successione ivi affiorante è spessa circa 10 m, è costituita prevalentemente da calcareniti e calciruditi bioclastiche con frammenti di rudiste, echinidi, coralli e gasteropodi alternati a calcari micritici bianchi poco cementati, ed è attribuibile alla Formazione dei Calcari di Monte Acuto, di età Cretaceo superiore – Paleocene inferiore. Gli strati della Formazione dei Calcari di Monte Acuto hanno spessori metrici, immergono verso est, e presentano una originaria inclinazione deposizionale (clinostratificazione) di circa 10°. All’interno dei singoli strati si passa, dal basso verso l’alto, da calcareniti e calciruditi bioclastiche, a luoghi con gradazione normale e laminazione piano-parallela, a calcari micritici. Dal punto di vista sedimentologico, i caratteri di facies di questa formazione indicano che l’intera successione è attribuibile ad ambienti marini corrispondenti ad un sistema deposizionale di scarpata progradante in cui dominavano processi di trasporto dei sedimenti per gravità (correnti di torbida e subordinatamente flussi granulari e di detrito). Il contenuto macropaleontologico è costituito in prevalenza da rudiste appartenenti alle seguenti specie: Hippurites colliciatus, Hippurites heritschi, Vaccinites ultimus, Durania austinensis, Favus antei, Sabinia klinghardti. Si tratta delle stesse specie di rudiste visibili nel settore delle Murge sud-orientali nei pressi di Ostuni e di Cisternino (schede CGP0140, CGP0147, CGP0148). Il sito di Coppa Caramanica è di notevole interesse scientifico per ricercatori, studenti e geoturisti perché permette di ricostruire in dettaglio, in un settore del Promontorio del Gargano tettonicamente poco deformato, le caratteristiche stratigrafiche e sedimentologiche tipiche di una successione deposta per processi deposizionali gravitativi in ambienti di scarpata.</description>

Ricavati in grotte naturali a strapiombo su gole silenziose o costruiti su inaccessibili speroni di roccia grigia, accolsero per secoli monaci anacoreti ed eremiti. Collegate tra loro da impervi sentieri e ripide scalinate, rifornite di acqua grazie a una rete di canali scavati nella roccia, le celle costituivano una sorta di villaggio rupestre,<br>isolato e difficilmente accessibile, con luoghi<br>dedicati alla vita comunitaria, alla preghiera<br>e al lavoro.

        <description>Sul colle di Pulsano, a circa 9 chilometri da Monte Sant’Angelo, sorgono i resti dell’antica abbazia, fondata nel VI secolo da San Gregorio Magno in un luogo frequentato da monaci anacoreti e cenobiti, sia orientali che latini. Distrutta dai saraceni, venne ricostruita agli inizi del XII secolo, periodo del suo massimo splendore, quando divenne uno dei più importanti centri di diffusione della cultura monastico-benedettina in Italia meridionale e in Dalmazia; decadde però rapidamente e visse lunghi periodi di oscurità, prima della sua soppressione in epoca napoleonica. Della struttura originaria rimangono le mura e l’ingresso al convento, con un portale finemente decorato con motivi vegetali; la chiesa in stile romanico è a navata unica, con abside ricavata da una grotta naturale. Attorno all’abbazia si apre un suggestivo scenario di rocce a strapiombo alte fino a 200 metri che accolse nei secoli numerosi eremiti e asceti. Lo testimoniano i resti di 24 eremi aggrappati ai dirupi o ricavati in grotte naturali su scoscese pareti di roccia, molti dei quali in luoghi davvero inaccessibili.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[Nel percorso si incontrano grotte e una necropoli, case rupestri e antiche chiese diroccate. Sorprendente è l'incontro con l’eremo di S. Martino. Il territorio si presenta molto selvaggio e molti passaggi sono su pietre e su cenge esposte ma percorribili con attenzione. La vista in cima è panoramica abbracciando il golfo di Manfredonia.<br>Distanza: 10,2 km<br>Durata: 5 ore<br>Quota massima: 782 m<br>Quota minima: 279 m<br><br>id: <br>slug: ]]></description>
