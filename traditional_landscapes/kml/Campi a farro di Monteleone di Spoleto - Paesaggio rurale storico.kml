    <name>Campi a farro di Monteleone di Spoleto - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Qui la coltura del farro, risalente all’epoca romana, viene condotta su campi ben delimitati da siepi e contribuisce senza dubbio a connotare la comunità locale e il suo paesaggio.<br>Il farro fu diffuso dai Romani in tutta la penisola poiché resistente alle malattie e particolarmente fecondo anche in terreni aridi, e nella zona di Monteleone si suppone che questa coltivazione non abbia mai subito interruzioni.<br>Oggi il farro occupa un posto marginale negli avvicendamenti e a volte viene anche seminato in successione all’erba medica. Il diserbo chimico non è mai stato praticato,la pianta è lasciata crescere secondo i canoni dell’agricoltura biologica. La raccolta avviene, secondo l’altitudine, fra la seconda metà del mese di luglio e la prima di agosto.<br>(foto: monteleonedispoletoeventi.it)]]></description>

L’importanza di tale coltura emerge anche in caso di cerimonie religiose, il 5 dicembre, infatti, alla vigilia della festa del patrono (san Nicola di Bari),il parroco riunisce gli abitanti per distribuire loro una minestra di farro benedetto, secondo un rituale in cui la distribuzione del cibo più povero non sancisce un’occasione straordinaria di ricchezza e abbondanza, né implica il sacrificio di qualcosa di prezioso da dividere, ma è invece il segno dell’identità di una comunità che comunica in modo egualitario al suo interno per mezzo di esso.<br>(foto: www.agraria.org)<br><br>IMPORTANTE: la localizzazione del prodotto in mappa è puramente indicativa.]]></description>
