    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Nei secoli passati ha rivestito un ruolo determinante per la formazione di quel complesso sistema economico e sociale che ha accompagnato la transumanza e che ha caratterizzato tutta l’area.<br> Numerosi sono i segni dell’uomo lungo il tratturo, dalla toponomastica riferibile alla transumanza alla realizzazione di fontanili, luoghi di culto, ricoveri e taverne, fino alla formazione di piccoli nuclei e, poi, di centri abitati. Gli insediamenti di Pescolanciano, Civitanova del Sannio e Montalto di Rionero si sono formati infatti in prossimità del tratturo Castel di Sangro-Lucera, quello di San Pietro Avellana in prossimità del Celano-Foggia.<br>Il paesaggio pastorale locale presenta una grande integrità, favorita anche dalla forma della proprietà, prevalentemente pubblica. Le radure sono regolarmente sfalciate mentre la gestione dei terreni boscati e pascolivi avviene attraverso i Piani di gestione forestale.<br>Lo spopolamento, l’abbandono e la quasi scomparsa della pastorizia hanno però comportato un lento incremento delle superfici boscate nelle radure, nelle aree marginali, nei seminativi e nei pascoli abbandonati.<br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2T2TX1Z)]]></description>
