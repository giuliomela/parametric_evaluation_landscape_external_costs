    <name>Colline di Montefalco - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

I terreni, di proprietà prevalentemente privata, si trovano ad altitudini comprese tra i 200 e i 500 m s.l.m.<br>La significatività dell’area risiede nella persistenza storica di un paesaggio caratterizzato da un mosaico agro-forestale complesso e ad elevata parcellizzazione che ha caratterizzato l’area, seppur in forme non sempre uguali, per diversi secoli. Al margine dei boschi gli uliveti ritagliano appezzamenti regolari ma discontinui, espandendosi in corrispondenza dei centri abitati, mentre nella collina coltivata si notano superfici rimboschite con il ciliegio.<br>La coltura principale resta quella olivicola, ancora condotta con impianti a sesto irregolare; i filari dei gelsi, come quelli di altre essenze arboree maritate alla vite, delineano i segni caratteristici del paesaggio ricordando le forme caratteristiche dell’alberata tosco-umbro-marchigiana tipica del sistema mezzadrile. Oggi nei vigneti locali è coltivato uno dei più preziosi vitigni d’Italia: il Sagrantino.<br>A nord si possono osservare dei vigneti su piccoli appezzamenti. Proprio la coltivazione della vite in nuove colture specializzate, sta mettendo a rischio l’assetto e la qualità paesaggistica. Con la crescita del mercato vitivinicolo sono infatti state sostituite le forme storiche colturali dei sistemi a girapoggio e a rittochino.<br>Il maggior ostacolo alla conservazione delle sistemazioni di collina è quello dell’avvento di nuove forme di meccanizzazione agricola basate sull’utilizzo di macchinari molto grandi.<br>(foto: http://www.consorziomontefalco.it)]]></description>
