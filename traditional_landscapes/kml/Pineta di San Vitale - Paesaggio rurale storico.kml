    <name>Pineta di San Vitale - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

La significatività dell’area riguarda la persistenza storica plurisecolare della pineta, sebbene essa oggi presenti numerose trasformazioni della sua struttura originale, rappresentando un caso emblematico del rapporto problematico fra paesaggio forestale storico e aree protette.<br>La pineta comprende il residuo più settentrionale e di maggiore ampiezza dell’antica pineta di Ravenna risalente all’epoca romana imperiale, durante la quale venne impiantata per la produzione del legname necessario alla costruzione di navi.<br>L’integrità dell’area presenta caratteri contraddittori: il pino domestico, con la caratteristica chioma a ombrello, che lascia sgombro lo spazio sottostante, consentendo anche la fruibilità turistica, è ormai affiancato ad altre specie quali farnia, pioppo, frassino, leccio, insieme a un fitto sottobosco, che spesso non consente nemmeno di percorrere la pineta, che si presenta ormai come un bosco misto.<br>Si può quindi affermare che, nonostante il mantenimento di alcune delle sue principali caratteristiche, l’integrità è compromessa per quanto riguarda la composizione specifica, per la mancanza di una gestione finalizzata al mantenimento delle sue caratteristiche storiche.<br> La sua vulnerabilità non vede come principale minaccia gli insediamenti industriali o turistici, peraltro in continua crescita nelle zone limitrofe, ma piuttosto la progressiva trasformazione della pineta in un’area seminaturale, con la perdita delle sue caratteristiche storiche.<br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2BL3H6k)]]></description>
