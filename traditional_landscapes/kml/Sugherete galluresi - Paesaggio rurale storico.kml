    <name>Sugherete galluresi - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Il paesaggio è caratterizzato da boschi pascolati, boschi sempreverdi di sughera e leccio, associati al sottobosco tipico della macchia mediterranea e intervallati da prati e pascoli nudi. <br>Qui il pascolamento con bovini ha prodotto una fustaia di sughera coetanea di età avanzata e si è creato un paesaggio profondamente radicato con le pratiche locali. Gli incendi estivi hanno invece dato luogo a un ceduo di sughera e leccio.<br>L’economia agricola gallurese trova le sue origini storiche nell’insediamento sparso di unità produttive autosufficienti: gli stazzi, piccoli insediamenti colonici di origine corsa, sviluppatisi alla fine del Settecento, funzionali alla pastorizia e all’agricoltura.<br>(foto: unsardoingiro.it)]]></description>
