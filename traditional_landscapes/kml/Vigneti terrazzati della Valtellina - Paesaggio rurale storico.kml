    <name>Vigneti terrazzati della Valtellina - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

La significatività dell’area è data dalla persistenza storica della coltivazione della vite su terrazzi con muri a secco, su versanti con pendenze particolarmente elevate, in taluni casi superiore al 70 per cento, i quali costruiscono un paesaggio spettacolare di grande valenza estetica.<br>La realizzazione dei terrazzamenti risale al periodo compreso tra il X ed il XIV secolo, ed ha consentito la messa a coltura di pendici molto acclivi attraverso un faticoso lavoro di modellamento delle montagne. Furono soprattutto i monaci che iniziarono l’interminabile opera di bonifiche, roncature (l’eliminazione del bosco per creare spazi coltivati) e terrazzamenti che permisero la coltivazione della vite, la cui massima espansione fu raggiunta nel XIX secolo. Le condizioni climatiche che caratterizzano questa area permettono la coltivazione dei vitigni di Nebbiolo, con ottimi risultati qualitativi.<br>L’integrità dell’area è legata al fatto che l’attuale paesaggio viticolo, oltre ai terrazzi, mantiene in gran parte l’estensione raggiunta nel XIX secolo.<br> Le difficoltà oggettive nella coltivazione delle aree terrazzate e i costi elevati delle produzioni spingono gradualmente a un abbandono delle coltivazioni, non solo a quote più elevate ma anche, in anni recentissimi, alle quote più basse dove è maggiore la valenza paesistico-ambientale, aumentando la vulnerabilità del paesaggio considerato.<br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2H5NMTP)]]></description>
