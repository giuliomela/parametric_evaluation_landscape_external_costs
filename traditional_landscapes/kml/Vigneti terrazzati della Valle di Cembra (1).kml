    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

        <name><![CDATA[Sei nel paesaggio rurale storico dei "Vigneti terrazzati della Valle di Cembra"]]></name>
        <description><![CDATA[descrizione: La Valle di Cembra, parte inferiore del corso dell'Avisio, è una delle più importanti valli laterali del corso del fiume Adige. Posizionata al centro del Trentino, mette in comunicazione Trento e la Piana Rotaliana con le valli di Fiemme e Fassa. La valle di Cembra appare a colpo d’occhio una meravigliosa enclave contenuta dai rilievi montuosi e segnata dalla profonda incisione del fiume Avisio. Sulle ripide pendici si sviluppa una teoria continua di terrazzamenti in porfido rosso, la bella pietra locale, coltivati a vigneto e punteggiati da borghi e case sparse. L’opera secolare di coltivazione di queste erte pendici, ha prodotto un paesaggio unitario, armonico, caratterizzato da un’agricoltura promiscua dove, su piccole proprietà, era coltivata la vite quasi sempre associata ad altre colture, ortaggi e alberi da frutto, ma anche seminativi e soprattutto prati e prati-pascoli necessari al mantenimento di qualche capo di bestiame, essenziale all’economia familiare. La relazione col bosco e in generale con le piante forestali è sempre stata stretta: boschi cedui di latifoglie, qualche castagneto da frutto, fustaie di conifere pure e in consociazione con il faggio, occupano ancora oggi la valle al di sopra dei 600-700 m s.l.m. di altitudine, mentre fasce vegetazionali seguono i torrenti e le roste per riconnettersi a fondo valle al fiume Avisio. La valle ha una superficie complessiva di circa 12.000 ha, di cui storicamente coltivati a vite circa il 6%. Le storiche cave di pregiato porfido rosso hanno assorbito dalla seconda metà del XX secolo molta manodopera, che altrimenti sarebbe emigrata alla ricerca di redditi ed impieghi più sicuri. Qui è rimasta, mantenendo come attività complementare la viticultura, parte integrante della cultura e dell’identità dei cembrani.<br>cat: 1<br>PT_PUB: YES<br>area: 22431653.16000<br>area_ha: 2243.16532]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[A partire dagli anni ´80, è avvenuto un radicale cambiamento nella percezione del vino e nelle modalità di consumo, che ha determinato un cambiamento profondo dello scenario produttivo portando la Valle di Cembra ad essere identificata oggi come un territorio di uve a bacca bianca. La prima varietà a guadagnare un nuovo ruolo da protagonista in valle è stata il di Müller Thurgau: molto produttiva anche in climi freddi, precoce nella vendemmia e con un buon livello zuccherino e di aromaticità genera un vino finito in tempo breve, particolarmente piacevole quando prodotto in zone di montagna e quindi facilmente commercializzabile. <br><br>cat: <br>PT_PUB: <br>area: <br>area_ha: ]]></description>

C., agganciandole alla Situla ritrovata al Doss Caslir in Cembra. Non è del tutto infondato pensare ad una viticoltura terrazzata, ove la vite fosse sostenuta da intreccio di pali in forma di pergola a tetto inclinato. In zone collinari tradizionalmente dominano le pergole semplici, dette puntaun, patäune, patein, punt, da cui anche il termine Puntwein, ovvero vino di pergola. Ancor oggi in Valle di Cembra quel numero di viti che sta tra un palo verticale ed il successivo, cioè un tratto di pergola, viene chiamato pont. Dunque in Valle di Cembra la pergola Trentina semplice è la forma di allevamento prevalente per la vite. Questa può essere allevata in due modi, a struttura semplice spezzata o concatenata; all’interno di queste esistono ulteriori variabili strutturali legate alla pendenza e alla lavorabilità meccanizzata degli appezzamenti. Nella pergola la vite è allevata in due dimensioni spaziali, verticale nel ceppo ed orizzontale per i tralci.<br><br>cat: <br>PT_PUB: <br>area: <br>area_ha: ]]></description>

Per le tipologie di uve non ancora contemplate dal disciplinare Trentino, in quanto di recente introduzione o qualora il produttore rinunci al processo di certificazione da parte dell’organo di controllo (autorizzato dal Ministero delle Politiche agricole alimentari, ovvero la Camera di Commercio Industria Artigianato e Agricoltura di Trento) il vino può essere autocertificato seguendo il disciplinare dell’Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT). Per la Valle di Cembra sono due gli IGT possibili: “Vigneti tipici delle Dolomiti” o “IGT delle Venezie”.<br><br>cat: <br>PT_PUB: <br>area: <br>area_ha: ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[I terrazzamenti ricavati dalla costruzione dei muri a secco, venivano messi a coltura seguendo le precise regole tipiche delle sistemazioni a girapoggio e cavalcapoggio, ovvero seguendo le curve di livelloche riprendono l’andamento naturale dei profili orografici, mentre i fossi di raccolta delle acque seguono le linee di massima pendenza. Una soluzione ingegnosa per ristorare i contadini che rientravano in paese con i carichi dell'uva nelle bigonce (congiàl), era prevedere all'interno del muretto a secco una sorta di rientranza in modo da poter appoggiarsi con il carico in spalla e riprendere fiato senza abbassarsi troppo (le cosidette "polse"), prima di riprendere la salita.<br><br>cat: <br>PT_PUB: <br>area: <br>area_ha: ]]></description>

Secondo le tecniche tradizionali, per realizzare un nuovo terrazzamen-to, l’appezzamento da mettere a coltura doveva essere liberato dalla vegetazione, ceppaie e radici e quindi spietrato per una profondità media di circa un metro. Le pietre, soprattutto porfidi, qui abbondanti, ma anche graniti e calcari, venivano levate dal terreno e ammassate ai bordi del campo e selezionate. Contemporaneamente nella parte infe-riore dell’appezzamento (vanegia) si procedeva alla costruzione dei muri di sostegno. Questi seguivano generalmente le curve di livello della montagna (a girapoggio o cavalcapoggio); laddove il versante era più ripido i muri si infittivano, mentre si distanziavano con pendenze più dolci. I muri erano e sono di tre tipologie: Opus incertum, con sassi molto irregolari e pietre grezze, Opus listatum ossia con pietre di porfido lavorate e squadrate, Opus poligonale con pietre di grandi di-mensioni lavorate grossolanamente in forma poliedrica, utilizzato nei muri di grandi dimensioni per garantire più stabilità.<br><br>cat: <br>PT_PUB: <br>area: <br>area_ha: <br><br><img src="https://mymaps.usercontent.google.com/hostedimage/m/*/3AEDAZkrvaniBlGIk-LvUWjxAZYh-1IKa599_BgCGJuCZqByjGRjyN22fhB8AcjAXLattq6PHCEWEL31aaO5qn8rr6T7HTQx53dfLIe8WCAnvJDJ1OYZjiJcaljhOKjBRVgiCww3xeHr6Rq235z-iNIlOiCVQUaHpyjSFrg8lcZuIglNR-P1fO-zcm-p5BF11cnpoWGJ2apocq2i2HeprXoasuZTEbIfreR3sBgEYmkNm7FKSMksaW2gFl5-ZHsY?authuser=0&fife=s16383" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Negli anni ´50 e fino agli anni 80, la Valle<br>di Cembra era una zona di produzione quasi esclusivamente di uve a bacca rossa, su tutte la Schiava, sia nella varietà Schiava Grossa che Gentile. Questa varietà era capace di produzioni abbondanti, e originava un vino a bassa gradazione alcolica, idoneo al largo consumo. Si trattava infatti di una sorta di ‘alimento’, sempre presente sulle tavole di tutte le famiglie e consumato anche in diversi momenti della giornata. A partire dagli anni ´80, è avvenuto un radicale cambiamento nella percezione del vino e nelle modalità di consumo, che ha determinato un cambiamento profondo dello scenario produttivo portando la Valle di Cembra ad essere identificata oggi come un territorio di uve a bacca bianca. La prima varietà a guadagnare un nuovo ruolo da protagonista in valle è stata il di Müller Thurgau. Successivamente, alla produzione di Müller Thurgau è stata affiancata quella di Chardonnay, la cui produzione negli ultimi anni è molto cresciuta per la richiesta di uve destinate alla spumantizzazione  (metodo classico Trentodoc). Tra le altre varietà si ricordano: Schiave, Pinot nero, Traminer aromatico, Pinot grigio e molte altre.]]></description>

        <description>Oggi paesi fantasmi, Masi e Ischiazza sorgevano lungo l’Avisio ai margini di un’ampia golena coltivata, circa 700 metri a valle della diga di Stramentizzo. Nel 1966 contava 44 abitanti ma durante l’alluvione che colpì con estrema forza il comune di Valfloriana, le piogge incessanti provocarono numerose frane e fiumi di fango invasero la zona. Gli abitanti di Ischiazza riuscirono a mettersi in salvo fuggendo verso le frazioni più alte. Passata la piena, tornarono nel paese quasi distrutto per recuperare quello che era possibile. Il 20 novembre 1966 gli scampati portarono in spalla il Cristo e gli arredi sacri della chiesa lungo la mulattiera fino alla frazione soprastante di Casatta, suggellando così la morte di Ischiazza e Masi. Di Ischiazza oggi sono rimasti solo i ruderi: si riconoscono la chiesetta, alcuni grandi edifici rurali diroccati, la vecchia fontana in pietra che sbuca dal terreno mentre si intravede tra gli alberi il magnifico torrente Avisio che scorre come in un canyon in fondovalle.</description>

In virtù di questo collegamento erano frequenti, per esempio, i matrimoni tra famiglie del Comune di Sover con altre originarie di Grauno e Grumes, mentre i sentieri diretti alla Bassa Atesina (zona di Salorno, Egna ed Ora) garantivano il travaso stagionale di manodopera attraverso il Dossone di Cembra. Una viabilità che sembrava irrimediabilmente perduta in seguito all’alluvione del 1966 ed ora al centro di un programma complessivo di recupero. La passeggiata restituisce il tessuto etnografico dell’alta valle, attraverso manufatti ed opifici (visitabili solo su prenotazione), che in alcuni casi, restarono in funzione sino agli anni Cinquanta del Novecento: le fornaci per la cottura della calce, certo non facile da reperire in un quadro geologico in cui domina, a tutti i livelli, il porfido permiano, i mulini azionati grazie alla deviazione di importanti corsi d’acqua e le fucine in cui si lavorava il metallo e i tessuti. La componente naturalistica è altrettanto degna di nota. La forra dell’Avisio in questo tratto presenta un alto indice di naturalità. Il sentiero è percorribile in due tratte.]]></description>

Ecco allora sorgere al margine dei campi dissodati, dei piccoli edifici piuttosto precari, inizialmente delle tettoie, con la funzione di contenere temporaneamente attrezzi e animali necessari alle lavorazioni, nonché, per breve tempo, i prodotti dell´attività agricola come fieno, patate o mosto. In seguito, tali costruzioni, dette baiti (al singolare bait), sono diventate più stabili, costruite in pietra e legno e con le tradizionali laste in porfido come copertura. solo alcune di queste costruzioni, sono state ingrandite nel tempo fino a configurarsi come delle vere e proprie dimore, dette masi (singolare mas), abitate tutto l’anno. Su tutto il paesaggio agrario quindi si sono venuti così a formare nella bassa e nell’alta Valle di Cembra molti edifici sparsi, classificabili secondo tre tipologie principali in base alla loro funzione: Edifici adibiti a deposito (bait), Edifici adibiti a deposito e ad abitazione temporanea (bait), Edifici adibiti ad abitazione stabile (mas).]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[La valle si presenta come una profonda incisione nella piattaforma porfirica Atesina, formazione vulcanica di età Paleozoica che si estende su un'area di circa 4.000 km² nella parte centro-orientale della regione Trentino Alto Adige. Si estende per circa 33 km, partendo a monte dalla confluenza con il Rio Cadino nel comune di Castello Molina (Val di Fiemme), e terminando con la forra di S. Giorgio, nel comune di Lavis, poco prima che il fiume Avisio si immetta nel fiume Adige, circa 8 km a nord di Trento. Il solco vallivo incide un bacino imbrifero di circa 90 km², nel quale scorre l'Avisio. Il torrente raccoglie lungo il suo tragitto numerose vallecole laterali con ruscelli e corsi d'acqua a portata molto variabile. La morfologia glaciale si evidenzia nella parte superiore dei versanti modellati dalla grandiosa azione erosiva, che ha smussato le superfici rocciose conferendo loro il caratteristico aspetto tondeggiante e lasciando a testimonianza numerose striature e scalfitture visibili in più luoghi della valle. Intensa è stata l'azione di deposito di materiali glaciali che ha depositato estese morene, in particolare nelle valli laterali degli affluenti dell'Avisio. Caratteristici della valle inoltre sono i numerosi affioramenti di porfido. La valle infatti, per la sua posizione all'interno della piattaforma porfirica atesina, è contraddistinta da numerosi formazioni (formazioni di Cembra, Gargazzone, Giovo, Gries e Lona) in cui il porfido è stratificato in strati particolarmente regolari, fitti e sottili.                                                                                 IMPORTANTE: la localizzazione dell'icona in mappa è puramente indicativa.]]></description>

I più coraggiosi possono provare l’esperienza del “river trekking”. L’Avisio, in Valle di Cembra, scorre in una profonda gola scavata nel porfido, un ambiente selvaggio e incontaminato che si è creato in secoli di scorrimento e di lavorío della roccia. Questo torrente, affluente dell’Adige, nasce a 2.028 m s.l.m. dal Lago di Fedaia ai piedi della Marmolada ed è il corso d’acqua principale che definisce la Valle di Cembra; il suo territorio infatti corrisponde alla parte inferiore del bacino del torrente. Dai piedi del ghiacciaio della Marmolada, l’Avisio attraversa il territorio delle Dolomiti e delle foreste di conifere delle valli di Fassa e Fiemme e per un terzo del suo corso, lungo 90 km, separa le due sponde della Valle dove lambisce colline incantate coltivate a vigneto e forre profonde. I più coraggiosi, possono esplorare il torrente praticando il “river trekking”, mentre gli amanti della pesca, regolamentata dall’APDT - Associazione Pescatori Dilettanti Trentini, possono lanciare l’amo in cerca di qualche esemplare di trota marmorata e trota fario.

Uno di loro, per porre fine al diverbio, pregò che la terra diventasse un lago. Il suo desiderio si avverò: da quel giorno l’acqua cominciò a salire dal sottosuolo, minacciando il vicino abitato di Cembra. Gli abitanti del villaggio, in segno di supplica, vi gettarono l’anello della Madonna. Le acque si fermarono e Cembra fu salva. Oggi il Lago Santo, a 1200 metri di quota e a 4 km dallo storico borgo di Cembra, è un ottimo punto di partenza per escursioni lungo il Dürerweg e il Sentiero Europeo E5. Il lago offre anche brevi tratti di spiaggia naturale in erba ed è balneabile. E per una sosta culinaria, nelle vicinanze del lago, due ristoranti tipici.

Lo specchio d'acqua colpisce subito per il colore delle acque turchesi e per essere incastonato tra pareti porfiriche rossastre in cui risaltano infatti le cave di estrazione del porfido. Meta molto apprezzata dai pescatori, il lago di Lases è anche un'ottima destinazione per chi ama le escursioni e chi ama fare un bagno estivo rinfrescante. Per chi invece è alla ricerca di un posto tranquillo dove trascorrere una pausa con gli amici, con famiglia e bambini o con l’ anima gemella, consigliamo un pic nic sulle morbide sponde del lago caratterizzate da spiagge a prato. Situato nel comune di Lona Lases, il bacino è uno dei più suggestivi del Trentino, qualificato da un ecosistema ricchissimo, tanto da fargli meritare l’istituzione di un biotopo di portata provinciale. Qui si ha anche la possibilità di osservare vari ambienti naturali e la Val Fredda con il particolare fenomeno delle buche di ghiaccio. I colori: lago dalle acque turchesi tra montagne dal colore tendente al rosso.<br><br>cat: <br>PT_PUB: <br>area: <br>area_ha: ]]></description>

Le origini di queste piramidi di terra, alte fino a 20 metri, risalgono a circa 20 mila anni fa quando il movimento dei ghiacciai dell'Avisio e la conseguente disgregazione dei fianchi della montagna produssero enormi depositi morenici. Le piramidi di Segonzano hanno varie forme: quella classica è di un tronco a cono sormontato da un masso. Accanto a questa si possono osservare le piramidi a punta con stelo conico e prive del masso di protezione: in genere queste non sono molto alte. Un'altra forma è quella a cresta, costituita da una lama di terreno seghettato e affilato, la cui formazione è dovuta all’assottigliamento dello spartiacque, compreso fra due canaloni. Le piramidi sono accessibili tutto l’anno tramite un percorso a piedi che, tra andata e ritorno, dura circa 2,45 h.

Una graziosa chiesetta di campagna ma soprattutto uno scrigno di pregevoli opere d’arte. Puoi raggiungerla con una breve passeggiata tra i vigneti, in circa un quarto d’ora dalla piazza del paese di Lisignago in Valle di Cembra. Al tuo arrivo, ti troverai davanti a un piccolo edificio in stile gotico della metà del Quattrocento, con un tetto a due spioventi e circondato da un grosso muro di porfido. La preziosità della chiesa è data dagli affreschi che ornano le pareti laterali. Le pitture, ben conservate, raffigurano l’ultima cena, la Trinità in una rara rappresentazione delle tre divine persone, la Madonna della Misericordia con autorità civili e religiose e infine Sant’Orsola con la bandiera crociata e un coro di vergini. Gli affreschi risalgono alla fine del 1400 e sarebbero riconducibili alla scuola pittorica bressinese. Infine, S. Leonardo è collocata su un'altura rocciosa che permette una visuale panoramica sulla vallata e sulla forra del fiume Avisio. Il ciclo pittorico quattrocentesco all’interno della chiesa e la posizione panoramica.]]></description>

Il paesaggio è arricchito dalla presenza di radure, aree umide e caratteristiche baite in porfido e legno. Si tratta di un luogo che vale la pena di scoprire: meritano il giro le vedute panoramiche sul gruppo Brenta e sulla catena del Lagorai e la visita alla chiesetta di San Leonardo. Una curiosità su tutte è data dal Cristo che ha trovato spazio nella piccolissima radura, opera di uno scultore Valdostano originario del paese di Lisignago, Silvano Ferretti. Il Piz dele Agole si raggiunge percorrendo la strada provinciale del Lago Santo in direzione Maderlina. In prossimità del rifugio SAT Maderlina, puoi parcheggiare la macchina per poi camminare per circa un’ora su strada forestale, lungo la quale s’incontrano numerose radure, piccole aree umide e caratteristiche baite in porfido e legno. Dal rifugio SAT Maderlina il tempo di percorrenza è di circa 2 ore, tra andata e ritorno. Un Cristo ligneo segnala il punto panoramico]]></description>

        <description>Dall’abitato di Lona, si scende verso il torrente Avisio seguendo una strada agricola (indicazioni per Pozzolago) che scende fino a raggiungere la Centrale di Pozzolago, un bell’esempio di architettura industriale che risale agli anni ‘20. È ancora in esercizio e sfrutta l’acqua della Catena del Lagorai proveniente dall’Altopiano di Piné grazie a una condotta che parte dal lago delle Piazze lunga circa 3,5 chilometri e con un salto di 604 metri di dislivello. Dalla centrale, una passerella sul fiume, il “Pont dele Formìghe”, permette di passare sull’altra sponda verso Cembra.</description>

Questo piccolo Santuario mariano situato nei pressi di Segonzano e immerso nel silenzio della natura fu fatto costruire con ogni probabilità verso la fine del Seicento ampliando la sua struttura iniziale che era costituita dalla sola cappella. All’interno di questo luogo di culto si possono ammirare il celebre quadro della Madonna dell’Aiuto (una copia della Mariahilf di Lucas Cranach conservata a Innsbruck) realizzato da un anonimo pittore tra il 1682 e il 1683. Un quadro avvolto dalla leggenda a cui sono attribuiti diversi miracoli. La leggenda vuole che il quadro sia stato trovato nel bosco, poi rimosso, quindi sparito e infine ritrovato nello stesso luogo originario. Da allora sono stati attribuiti al dipinto diversi miracoli che hanno ispirato il pellegrinaggio dei fedeli. Il suggestivo fascino del dipinto “miracoloso” della Madonna dell’Aiuto.]]></description>

Ammira il suo stile tardo gotico e scopri i suoi affreschi. Fondata in epoca altomedievale – recenti scavi hanno fatto emergere una struttura precedente risalente al V-VI secolo - questa chiesa in stile tardo gotico situata a Cembra conserva nel presbiterio i resti di una rara cella memoriale in pietra e muratura realizzata per custodire le reliquie di santi e benefattori. All’interno dell’edificio è possibile ammirare molte opere pittoriche tra cui un ciclo affrescato della vita di Cristo risalente al XVI secolo. L’opera più affascinante resta però la raffigurazione del Giudizio Universale dipinta dal pittore barocco trentino Valentino Rovisi, un esponente della scuola del Tiepolo attivo nel Settecento. L’audio guida Francesca, attraverso un sistema informativo diffuso, fatto di totem digitali cui potrai collegarti facilmente e gratuitamente, ti accompagnerà in un viaggio alla conoscenza del valore storico - artistico di questo luogo. La presenza di un bellissimo affresco del pittore barocco Valentino Rovisi]]></description>

Passerelle e pedane ti permettono di fare un'immersione nella storia di questo angolo di Trentino. I maestosi ruderi merlati del Castello di Segonzano spuntano da uno sperone roccioso che domina la Valle di Cembra. Oggi puoi visitarli grazie alla vasta azione di recupero che ha reso questo sito visitabile con percorsi di visita, pedane, passerelle e strutture utili a ospitare eventi storici e culturali. Il castello fu edificato nel Medioevo per volere del principe vescovo Federico Vanga che ne intuì la posizione strategica per i traffici della Valle dell'Adige che passavano il ponte di Cantilaga sul torrente Avisio. La sua importanza fu massima tra Trecento e Quattrocento. Della costruzione duecentesca e dei rimaneggiamenti cinquecenteschi rimangono solo pochi muri. La fama del castello si deve ai celebri acquarelli che Albrecht Dürer dipinse nel 1494, quando passò per il Trentino in occasione del suo primo viaggio in Italia. La vista suggestiva e i percorsi di visita che permettono di vivere a pieno l'esperienza.]]></description>

L'abside poligonale conserva due finestre gotiche in arenaria, mentre sulla parete meridionale sono visibili tracce di una grande Ultima cena affrescata. Giambattista Ghezzi di Faedo fu l'ultimo eremita di San Giorgio. II romitorio fu soppresso dalla legge emanata da Giuseppe II nel 1782.]]></description>

Vigilio nel IV secolo abbattè il tempio dedicato agli dèi Giove e Walter per erigere al suo posto una croce, che sarà poi il luogo di costruzione della chiesa. La costruzione è in arenaria, massiccia con robusti costoloni e una geometria sobria.

È un antichissimo e scenografico sistema per catturare uccelli, attivo fino alla fine degli anni '60.<br>Il Roccolo del Sauch, in Val di Cembra, è un sistema antichissimo per la cattura degli uccelli. Si tratta di una costruzione vegetale di alberi di faggio e abete opportunamente intrecciati e potati, così da creare una galleria praticabile con al centro uno spiazzo erboso e un piccolo edificio. Quando i volatili si posavano nello spazio al centro della galleria, dalla casetta veniva agitato lo “spauracchio” preceduto dal fischio dell’uccellatore; la fuga in senso orizzontale portava gli uccelli dritti verso una rete pressoché invisibile, tesa tra le arcate della galleria. Dal 1968 questo strumento di caccia è proibito e il sito, di proprietà della famiglia Brugnara, è stato trasformato prima in osservatorio e centro didattico ambientale e oggi, con la chiusura del centro, rimane visibile a tutti coloro che percorrono i sentieri della zona. Nelle dirette vicinanze, per un pranzo tipico, il Rifugio Sauch. La possibilità di scoprire un sistema antichissimo per la cattura degli uccelli, oggi vietato.]]></description>
