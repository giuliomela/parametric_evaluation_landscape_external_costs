    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Il paesaggio è caratterizzato dalla coltivazione di oliveti, in parte a terrazzati, e contigui a vigneti; una parte degli oliveti del comprensorio è distribuita razionalmente secondo distanze prestabilite, che si ripetono dando una fisionomia di regolarità al paesaggio.<br>Qui gli olivi appartengono alla varietà Dritta - diffusasi alla fine dell’‘800 - una delle più antiche presenti in Abruzzo, ed è caratterizzata da un albero con portamento espanso e chioma non molto folta. Trovandosi nella zona Vestina, nel bacino del fiume Tavo, gli oliveti possono usufruire di un articolato sistema di irrigazione. Nonostante l’industrializzazione dell’agricoltura del Novecento, l’area presenta caratteri di integrità del paesaggio grazie alla presenza di antichi ordinamenti colturali e alla presenza di olivi secolari; l’elevata attività economico-rurale non ha determinato impatti sul paesaggio.<br>A Loreto Aprutino vi è anche una tradizione vinicola che nasce in antica epoca romana e pagana; infatti, in località Fiorano, o Floranum, i romani festeggiavano il vino due volte all’anno, in aprile e in agosto, con il nome Vinalia. Fin da allora in questi luoghi veniva coltivato il Trebbiano d’ Abruzzo con il nome “Trebulanum”.<br> A Loreto Aprutino è inoltre nato il Consorzio di tutela del Tondino del Tavo, una varietà di fagiolo riscoperta e coltivata da alcuni agricoltori del paese.<br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2UVV1Bf)]]></description>
