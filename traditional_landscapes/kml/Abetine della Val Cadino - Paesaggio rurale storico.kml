    <name>Abetine della Val Cadino - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali]]></description>

Una particolarità che distingue la gestione dei boschi locali è l’impiego del taglio raso (taglio di tutte le piante presenti su una porzione di bosco) localmente chiamato «taglio a fratta», che ha portato alla formazione di boschi a struttura coetanea. Fu anche sviluppato un sistema di trasporto tramite risine e cave, cioè canali in legno o pietra, costruiti lungo le pendici montuose per consentire il trasporto dei tronchi durante l’inverno grazie al ghiaccio e alla neve. Erano presenti anche le stue, sbarramenti temporanei posti lungo i torrenti per accumulare grandi quantità di acqua per spingere a valle i tronchi e le «segherie alla veneziana», opifici mossi dalla forza dell’acqua e impiegati per la segagione del legname.<br>Il paesaggio della valle è ancora sostanzialmente integro nelle sue componenti boscate; la vulnerabilità dell’area è legata alla ridotta importanza della produzione legnosa rispetto al passato e alla estraneità dei manufatti storici rispetto alle tecniche di esbosco e trasporto attuali, incentrate sulla meccanizzazione delle varie fasi di lavorazione.<br>(foto: Le fustaie di conifere della Val Cadino<br>https://www.lifeintravel.it/giro-della-cascata-e-val-cadino-in-val-di-fiemme-in-mtb.html)]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Curiosità: In questa valle, cento anni fa, è nato il famoso albero di Natale di Roma del 2017,  denominato Spelacchio per aver perso parte della chioma durante il trasporto. Sopravvissuto a una grande frana nel 1966, è cresciuto fino a raggiungere i 40 metri di altezza e i quasi due metri di diametro. Dopo la dismissione da Piazza Venezia a Roma è stato portato in segheria dove avrà una seconda vita perché servirà per la costruzione di Baby little home, casetta in legno che sarà donata alla Capitale e che consentirà alle mamme di accudire i propri bambini in sicurezza e privacy.<br> (https://www.repubblica.it/ambiente/2018/04/17/news)<br> <br>IMPORTANTE: La localizzazione dell'icona in mappa è puramente indicativa]]></description>
