    <name>Pascoli alti della Dame di Challant - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

La stabilità nei secoli di questo paesaggio storico, frutto dell’allevamento d’alta quota, che ha da sempre costituito la principale risorsa della Valle d’Aosta, lo rende unico.<br>A quote particolarmente elevate, solitamente intorno ai 1800-2000 m s.l.m., dove neppure la segale poteva essere coltivata, l’unico prodotto che la terra poteva offrire era l’erba. I pochi capi di bestiame di ciascuna famiglia, che d’inverno erano tenuti in stalla e nutriti col fieno, nelle mezze stagioni venivano trasferiti in baite di mezza montagna al fine di lasciar crescere l’erba nelle zone sfalciabili per immagazzinare foraggio per l’inverno. Il bestiame veniva poi d’estate dato in affitto a pastori, spesso provenienti con le loro bestie dalla pianura, che lo riunivano in grandi mandrie e lo portavano al pascolo nelle zone alte, che non potevano offrire altra risorsa che questa.<br>L’uso a pascolo della zona è documentato da moltissimi inventari, atti notarili testamentari e di compravendita dal XIII al XX secolo, controversie e processi relativi all’uso o al possesso, atti di infeudazione in cui vengono descritti i terreni e i loro confini. ]]></description>
