    <name>Oliveti a bosco di Lucinasco - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://mymaps.usercontent.google.com/hostedimage/m/*/3AEDAZkpOL_yegZmVU88jd8YQnUL-nwspvR1AveMJnAJqV_EmdKo5w1nIZ2KNreW2EC3EXxvY33I6PFYrMCtRCrKiLtmolA-bhRa48NUzagBAVn7bFzQSEUlBeheVPlYsvhZVcV-bGsL8Zz777igFcyCEd7jNZkR9hwZQ5TsjHurcd-bb8Par8DTKAR84-Av7wyqvytikvIkg6QAWpg?authuser=0&fife=s16383" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br>L’area, situata nel comune di Lucinasco (Imperia), presenta un paesaggio di oliveti a bosco particolarmente significativo, non solo per la persistenza storica, ma anche per come gli olivi sono stati piantati e per l’opera di rimodellamento delle pendenze piuttosto accentuate. Gli agronomi liguri del XIX secolo già conoscevano il sistema colturale detto «oliveto a bosco», caratterizzato da esemplari di grandi dimensioni,anche a sesto di impianto sparso, dove si traeva un guadagno anche dalla produzione erbacea delle terrazze, in un regime consuetudinario di accesso alle risorse.<br>Storicamente il rapporto dell’ulivo con le pratiche pastorali ha contribuito a modellare il paesaggio agrario con l’associazione, tipica della Riviera di Ponente, delle caselle, cioè costruzioni tronco-coniche in pietra a secco utilizzate da pastori e contadini,con l’ulivo terrazzato, varietà “taggiasca”.<br>Questo rapporto è stato facilitato dal fatto che la Valle del Maro era un’importante sede dei pascoli estivi e di alpeggi dell’allevamento transumante. Gli olivi sono oggi destinati alla produzione di olio Riviera Ligure DOP e anche di olive per uso alimentare. La vulnerabilità del paesaggio è legata alla scomparsa del pascolo negli oliveti, se non per qualche raro capo ovino, più che all'abbandono della olivicoltura. Altri elementi di vulnerabilità sono legati alla diffusione di tecniche di recupero degli oliveti estranee alle pratiche tradizionali e che modificano l'architettura della chioma.<br>(foto: A.
