    <name>Prati e pascoli alberati del formaggio di Santo Stefano - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Di questa tradizione, sono ancora visibili le strutture in pietra (cassùn) utilizzate tuttora dai pastori nei mesi in cui i pascoli restano in quota, così come i fienili a tetto mobile (barchi) e i locali in pietra (canevìn) per la stagionatura del formaggio, che sono legati allo sviluppo locale dell’allevamento bovino stanziale.<br>(foto : A .
