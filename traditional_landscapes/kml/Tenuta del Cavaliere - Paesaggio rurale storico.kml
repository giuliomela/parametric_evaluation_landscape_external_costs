    <name>Tenuta del Cavaliere - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

L’area ha quindi un elevatissimo grado di significatività storica e culturale per il paesaggio laziale, soprattutto in considerazione della vicinanza con la città di Roma e di essere un’area agricola tipica dei «poli urbani», così come definiti dal Piano strategico nazionale di sviluppo rurale.<br>La Tenuta del Cavaliere, a differenza di molte altre aree dell’agro romano contemporaneo, ha conservato una grande integrità e un’elevata leggibilità del paesaggio: un patrimonio rurale che acquista un valore ancora maggiore se confrontato con i quartieri dell’adiacente periferia romana, privi di significative aree verdi.<br> La Tenuta viene periodicamente aperta ad attività ricreative e culturali: qualità dei prodotti, bellezza del paesaggio e iniziative sociali per recuperare il patrimonio storico della campagna romana ne fanno un pregevole esempio di multifunzionalità dell’agricoltura.<br>La vulnerabilità della Tenuta è fortemente legata alla crescita delle aree urbanizzate circostanti ed alle periodiche esondazioni del vicino fiume Aniene, spesso particolarmente distruttive, che possono compromettere le coltivazioni stagionali e danneggiare alcune infrastrutture.<br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2Tc6mjE)]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Il ceduo è una forma di governo del bosco; in seguito al taglio delle piante, il rinnovamento avviene ad opera dei polloni (nuovi fusti) che si originano da gemme presenti sulla ceppaia (la base del tronco che rimane sul terreno dopo l’abbattimento) mediante riproduzione per via vegetativa (agamica).<br>Tra le specie forestali della penisola soltanto le latifoglie sono dotate di capacità pollonifera.]]></description>
