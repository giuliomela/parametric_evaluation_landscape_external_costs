    <name>Piana del Fucino a Ortucchio - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

Il lago misurava oltre 150 Km2 e il primo a tentarne il prosciugamento fu Giulio Cesare seguito da Tiberio, ma soltanto l’imperatore Claudio decise di intraprendere i lavori, impiegando undici anni e 30mila schiavi, senza raggiungere l’esito previsto.<br>Nel 1854 Alessandro Torlonia decise di avviare una nuova bonifica che consistette nel prosciugamento, bonifica e realizzazione di una fitta rete di canali lunga 285 km con 238 ponti, 3 ponti canali e 4 chiuse. Con la riforma agraria del 1950 i terreni, ad uso agricolo, furono assegnati ai residenti dei comuni limitrofi. Quando i Torlonia abbandonarono i possedimenti, nacque l’Ente Fucino.<br>Nell’area sono diventate predominanti le coltivazioni di grano e di barbabietola da zucchero, coltivazione importante fino al 1987, anno di chiusura dello zuccherificio di Avezzano. Ora vi si coltivano la Carota del Fucino IGP (Indicazione geografica protetta che rappresenta il 30% della produzione italiana), la Patata del Fucino IGP e alcune specie orticole come radicchio, lattuga, finocchio e cavolfiori.<br>L’area rappresenta un paesaggio agrario italiano unico nel suo genere; malgrado la frammentazione aziendale, l’ordinata divisione delle aree agricole in centinaia di lotti rettangolari tutti pressoché uguali tra loro, divisi da lunghe strade rettilinee, la superficie risulta armonica sotto il profilo visivo.<br>Un elemento di vulnerabilità potrebbe essere il passaggio da un’agricoltura tradizionale a una intensiva con maggior impiego di acqua per i processi di trasformazione e confezionamento, con conseguente scarsità di risorse idriche; i pozzi tendono a prosciugarsi in primavera-estate e sembra non bastare nemmeno il ricorso a una migliore manutenzione dei canali.<br>(foto: https://bit.ly/2GxBC6E)]]></description>
