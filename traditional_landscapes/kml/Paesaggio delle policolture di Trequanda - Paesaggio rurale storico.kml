    <name>Paesaggio delle policolture di Trequanda - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.<br><br>Le foto sono state messe gentilmente a disposizione dal Comune di Trequanda e dalla Città dell'Olio]]></description>

Su ogni terrazza sono disposte generalmente una o due file di olivi e non vi è normalmente la possibilità di accedervi con mezzi meccanici. Le disposizioni di materiale lapideo maggiormente diffuse nell’area sono riconducibili a quelle della geometria identificativa dell’Opus incerta, con pietre poco lavorate e dalla forma per lo più irregolare, posizionate in modo da risultare il più possibile connesse fra di loro. I manufatti presentano eterogeneità in termini di materiale lapideo utilizzato, pezzatura e grado di lavorazione delle pietre. Inoltre i muretti in pietra a secco nella quasi totalità dei casi sono a raso terra, ovvero con la sommità del muro allo stesso livello del piano coltivato e con paramento murario singolo.<br>foto: associazione nazionale Città dell'Olio]]></description>
