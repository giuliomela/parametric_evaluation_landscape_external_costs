    <name>La Farnesiana - Paesaggio rurale storico</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Progetto della Rete Rurale Nazionale per la valorizzazione dei paesaggi rurali storici censiti nel "Catalogo nazionale dei paesaggi rurali storici" (Laterza, 2010). L’Italia offre un patrimonio incomparabile di paesaggi forgiati dall’ uomo nel corso dei secoli, che per caratteristiche ed elementi di significatività e storicità, rappresentano un obiettivo primario di tutela e conservazione. Il volume presenta il risultato di una ricerca promossa dal Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari, Forestali e del Turismo, in collaborazione con 14 università italiane e alcuni enti di ricerca internazionali.]]></description>

In questi ambienti si è perfettamente adattata la razza bovina maremmana, i cui capi, forti e resistenti alle difficoltà climatiche, sono adatti ai terreni marginali e ai foraggi scadenti.<br>Gran parte della superficie è ricoperta da macchia mediterranea e da bosco misto di querce, con una prevalenza di cerri e lecci; il versante sud-occidentale è caratterizzato dalla presenza di una vasta sughereta. Sia il bosco sia la sughereta, sottoposti a regolare trattamento, ricoprono una funzione fondamentale nell’allevamento brado delle vacche maremmane.<br>Un’ampia porzione della tenuta è invece lasciata a prato asciutto, con sfalcio annuale per il pascolo delle mandrie, mentre alcuni ettari sono destinati alla rotazione di seminativi non irrigui tra cui si contano il grano duro, il favino, l’avena e l’orzo.<br>Il luogo in cui si estende la tenuta attuale corrisponde pressappoco a quello che in epoca medievale veniva chiamato il «Campo della Mola», che era il centro della vecchia tenuta. La presenza dell’antico centro agricolo, con il piccolo borgo, l’imponente chiesa neogotica, il granaio, e altri edifici funzionali all’attività agricola, contribuiscono ad aumentare il fascino e la particolarità dell’area. <br>(foto: illaziodeimisteri.wordpress.com)]]></description>

        <description>Il clima e la morfologia del luogo hanno fatto sì che in quest’area, a poca distanza tra loro o spesso a contatto, vegetino specie e associazioni vegetali tipiche dell’orizzonte mediterraneo, come ad esempio la sughera, il leccio, il corbezzolo (localmente chiamato “cerasa marina”), insieme a specie caratteristiche di ambienti freschi montani appenninici, come il faggio e l’agrifoglio.</description>
